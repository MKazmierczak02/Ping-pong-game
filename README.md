# Ping-pong-game
The Ping Pong game that I made is my test of the knowledge that I've learned with pygame and OOP.
I Added there Full-Menu setup with Main Menu and Settings, So basicly you can run it on your Nintendo.

To Run:

-git clone git@github.com:MKazmierczak02/Ping-pong-game.git

-open main.py and run it
